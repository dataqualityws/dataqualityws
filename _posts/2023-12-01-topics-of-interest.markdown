  New approaches for performing <b> Data quality </b> assessment or improvement <b>of Knowledge Graphs via Machine Learning</b>
  - Quality assessment over the time
  - Scalability issues
  - Proactive approaches able to improve KG quality during the data authoring stage
  - Reactive approaches to improve KG quality before the data exploitation stage
  - Large Language Models to deal with KG quality issues
  - Generative Artificail Intelligence (AI) to cope with KG quality issues
  - AI-driven approach to assess and improve data quality issues over KGs
  
  Applications combining Machine Learning and Knowledge Graphs dealing with Data Quality concerns:
  - Recommender Systems leveraging (incomplete) Knowledge Graphs
  - Link Prediction and completing KGs
  - Ontology Learning and Matching coping with KG consistency and accuracy
  - Question Answering exploiting Knowledge Graphs and Machine Learning dealing with representational issues 
  - Domain Specific KGs quality issues
