**Title**: **When stars align: studies in data quality, knowledge graphs, and machine learning**

**Abstract**: In this talk I will present several projects that tease out the intricate relationship between these three fields of research to produce better AI datasets and, with that, better AI models and downstream applications. I will start with work in knowledge graphs, which are machine-readable structured data representations, organised for general-purpose use. Besides data integration, they are extensively used in search engines, recommender systems, virtual assistants and other AI contexts, commonly as a source of domain knowledge and explanations. I propose sociotechnical methods, drawing on machine learning and other techniques, to understand biases, improve the quality, and increase people's trust in knowledge graphs. Then I will move to ongoing work on assuring any type of AI dataset, using semantic technologies. I will introduce the data-centric AI programme at the Open Data Institute and deep dive into Croissant, a schema.org-based vocabulary to describe AI datasets to improve their quality and reuse.
